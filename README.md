# Our Journey
## Inspiration
As we noticed in our day-to-day lives, we are not fully aware of the cultures surrounding our diverse environments. Our inspiration stemmed from a profound interest in learning about community equity, diversity, and inclusion. We were captivated by the idea of creating a platform that could foster connections and understanding among people from different backgrounds.

## What it does
Walk in the Park functions as a gamified map game, akin to Pokemon Go, where users can visit various locations. Each location provides a curated song selected by AI and information crafted by AI, educating users about the historical struggles of different communities and their current impact on society. It serves as a tool for community engagement and self-awareness, encouraging users to explore and learn about diverse cultures.

## How we built it
We developed Walk in the Park as a mobile application with cross-platform capabilities. Utilizing a combination of languages and frameworks, we ensured a seamless user experience. Our approach involved extensive collaboration and experimentation to create a cohesive product that aligned with our vision.

## Challenges we ran into
Throughout the development process, we encountered several challenges. One major hurdle was emulating consistent environments for each team member, ensuring parity in our experiences. Additionally, navigating server-related issues proved to be a significant obstacle that required creative problem-solving and collaboration to overcome.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We take pride in successfully creating a fully functional product that holds genuine community impact potential. Our team's dedication and perseverance allowed us to overcome obstacles and deliver a compelling solution that aligns with our values of inclusivity and education. That's how we came up with the concept of "Walk in the Park," a mobile app that has the goal of fostering empathy, understanding, and cultural awareness through gamified exploration and curated educational content.

## What we learned
Working on Walk in the Park provided us with invaluable learning experiences. We gained expertise in new technologies and frameworks, pushing ourselves to explore alternative approaches such as utilizing Gemini over GPT. Furthermore, the project deepened our understanding of community dynamics and the importance of fostering empathy and understanding across diverse backgrounds.

## What's next for Walk in the Park
Looking ahead, our focus is on refining the app's algorithm to enhance user retention and engagement. Additionally, we plan to implement marketing strategies to build a supportive community around the app, fostering meaningful connections and dialogue among users. Continual iteration and improvement will be key as we strive to maximize the positive impact of Walk in the Park.
